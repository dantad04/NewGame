I  tried some more complicated features like mobs glowing red and chain explosions, but they broke the game. So, I went with simpler stuff to learn Godot better.

Mobs now spawn faster over time.
I added collectible coins to the map.
There's a new score counter for the coins.
I gave the bullets a lighting effect. (Just for fun)

I also had some issues with Git which I will implement better as I only just realised I wasn't committing right

I also used AI for the mob spawning increase
