I  tried some more complicated features like mobs glowing red and chain explosions, but they broke the game. So, I went with simpler stuff to learn Godot better.


Updating slime lighting + chain explosions that never worked  (2.5 hours)
Mobs now spawn faster over time. (15 minutes)
I added collectible coins to the map. (30 minutes)
There's a new score counter for the coins. (10 minutes)
I also added a 'health restoration' feature to the coins (5 minutes)
I gave the bullets a lighting effect. (Just for fun) (30 minutes playing around with it)

I also had some issues with Git which I will implement better as I only just realised I wasn't committing right (1-2 hours)

I also used AI for the mob spawning increase
